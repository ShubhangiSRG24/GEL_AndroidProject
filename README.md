The above chart represents the number of overseas personnals visiting Korea from 2010 to 2021. The number of overseas tourists and visitors continued to increase before the COVID-19 incident. In line with the demand caused by the increase in overseas tourists and overseas visitors, public institutions carry out various IT service projects for foreigners. 


Various web/app applications have been launched, and services for foreigners in emergencies have also came out. Which is the [EmergencyReadyApp](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=kr.go.nema.disasteralert_eng&hl=ko&gl=US), managed by the Ministry of the Interior and Safety. **_And we found the EmergencyReadyApp contains several problems._**

### Problems
1. Translations: [Emergency Alerts For Foreigners Get Lost In Translation](http://tbs.seoul.kr/eFm/newsView.do?typ_800=P&idx_800=3449286&seq_800=20441863)
2. Unfriendly UI/UX
3. Services with low usability
      - Search Shelter, Emergency Medical Centers, Fire Stations, Police Stations: Just information of locations
      - Safety Guide: Videos such as CPR for infants, CPR for Adults, First Aid(Burn injuries from fires), Fire Extinguisher and indoor fire hydrant
      - 119 Emergency Call (Direct Call)
      - Disaster Alert translation
4. Low visibility, no feedback, no affordance
